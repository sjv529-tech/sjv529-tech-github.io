    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a first-year Computer Science student learning the fundamentals of programming, web development, computer architecture, and databases.</p>
    <p>I am currently looking for internship and placement opportunities where I can develop my skills in web development and data engineering.</p>
    <p>Outside my studies, I enjoy hackathons, coding challenges, and working on small side projects.</p>

    <h2>What I am working on now</h2>
    <p>
      Right now I am learning SQL for working with databases and practising Java programming
      to strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next year I aim to build small web applications that connect a web front end
      to a real database, so I can practise full-stack development and data handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly interested in roles and projects related to web development and data engineering,
      where I can design efficient systems and work with real-world datasets.
